## Assignment 03: your first useful program

In this assignment, you are going to develop your first useful Python program: a
script to compute the roots of a quadratic equation. You are going to go through
four iterations of your code with increasing level of complexity and
sophistication. You are going to be guided in the entire process. (Soon
be able to build programs like this (and more complicated) on your own.)

Your program is going to be called `quadratic.py` and is going to take three
numbers from the command line. These are the coefficients of the quadratic
equation you want to solve. For instance, if you want to find the roots of
`x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0`, you will execute your code as `./quadratic.py 1 2 1` and the
output will be the two roots.

### What you have to do

The body of the assignment is in `quadratic_explained.py`, so you should go
carefully over that file, paying attention to the TODO items. We extracted the
code from `quadratic_explained.py` to `quadratic.py`. You can read the
explanations in the former and complete the second, or work directly on the
first one (if you do so, your script is going to be called with
`./quadratic_explained.py`).

The code defines four functions `quadraticN`, most of which incomplete. You will
need to complete the missing statements. In doing this, you should run your
program to check that it is working as expected. For instance, `quadratic0` is
already complete. Run the code to a variety of inputs and check that the
solutions are what you are expecting. Once you have completed and tested a
function, make a git commit of your progress.
